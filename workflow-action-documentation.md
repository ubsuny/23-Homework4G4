# Using Github Actions to Automatically Lint and Unit Test Commits to Repository

## Changelog

### Algorithm
The periodic time calculation algorithm (contained in module_file.py) is largely unchanged. The one exception is that instead of using a lambda function,
```Python
calculate_periodic_time= (lambda l: 2* math.pi/ math.sqrt(g / l))
return calculate_periodic_time
```
The calculation is simply contained in the return statement
```Python
return 2 * math.pi * math.sqrt(l / g)
```
To make the module more compact.

### Implementation

For the implementation `perpendulum.py`, there are a couple of key differences. Notably, in the original file `Period.py`, the user is prompted to enter a list of lengths
```Python
lengths_list = input("Enter a list of length, separated by commas: ")
```
Which has now been replaced by a hard coded list
```Python
lengths_list = [1,2,3,4]
```
To comply better with the linting/unit testing process.

Additionally, the original Pendulum.py imports the `algorithm calculate_periodic_time()` from a seperate module, while the finalized perpendulum.py opts to define the algorithm within the file.

## Action Implementation
### Linting

The linting action is implemented in the file `final_lint.yml`. Generally speaking, it will automatically lint every file that is pused to the main branch of the repository. Here's how it works:


We start by defining the trigger. This means that this action will run whenever there is a push to the main branch of the repo
``` YAML
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
```

Now we run some initialization steps. We run the action on ubuntu with python version 3.8. We also need to checkout the code for it to be linted on this machine.
```YAML
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: 3.8
```

We now need to install all necessary dependencies. We first make sure to install the latest version of pip, the python package manager. This will allow us to install pylint.
```YAML
name: Install dependencies
      
      run:
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

We then install pylint
```YAML
name: Install linter
      run:
        pip install pylint
```

We finally lint the pushed code via
```YAML
name: lint final_code.py
      run: pylint final_code.py || exit 0
```

### Unit Testing

For the unit test, we follow the same steps in the unit.yml file until we install the necessary dependencies. We now need to install pytest with 
```YAML
pip install pytest
```
And we then unittest the file pushed with
```YAML
pytest unit.py
```
